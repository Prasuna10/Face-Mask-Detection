# Face-Mask-Detection
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus.I have developed a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not and model is trained using Keras and OpenCV.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset(The dataset consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.)
